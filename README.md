# 🧠🌀 BrainRot LeetCode Typer

Welcome to **BrainRot** — the most unhinged way to practice LeetCode ever conceived. If grinding problems wasn’t painful enough, now you get to **type every solution by hand** while your brain slowly melts 🫠⌨️

Because real understanding comes from **suffering productively**.

---

## 😵‍💫 What is this?

BrainRot is a **brain-training / brain-destroying app** where you:

* 🧩 Pick a LeetCode problem
* ⌨️ **Type the entire solution from scratch** (no copy-paste, no mercy)
* 🧠 Build muscle memory, intuition, and questionable sanity
* 🔁 Repeat until enlightenment or burnout (whichever comes first)

Think of it as:

> *Monkeytype 🐒 + LeetCode 🧠 + sleep deprivation 😴*

---

## 🔥 Why would I do this?

Because:

* ✨ You *think* you understand DP… until you have to type it
* 🧠 Typing forces **active recall** (aka the good kind of pain)
* 🚀 Great for interview prep
* 😈 Perfect if you enjoy controlled suffering

Also it’s kind of funny.
